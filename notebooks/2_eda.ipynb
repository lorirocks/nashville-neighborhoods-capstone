    "1. Which neighborhoods have had the most, and the least, growth during the past three years based on the count of building permits by type, and by cost of construction.\n",
    "2. Do any neighborhoods have recent increases in building permit applications which may signal growth in the near future?\n",
    "3. In instances where zoning changes are sought, might those be a leading indicator of a subsequent increase in building permit applications? If so, what is the average time lag?\n",
